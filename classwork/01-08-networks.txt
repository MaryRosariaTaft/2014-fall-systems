how do networks work?
through nets

why do we need networks when we can just have floppy drives lined up next to each other and have them shoot the floppy disks back and forth



====OSI 7-layer model====

- used to help conceptualize the different parts of network connections

top layer is the most concrete; each subsequent layer becomes more abstract (relying less on physical conenctions and more on code; each relies on the success of all the previous)

1. physical
2. data link
3. network
4. transport
5. session
6. presentation
7. application

==================

1: PHYSICAL

e.g. electricity (wooo), radio signal pulses, etc.

history time!
- Thicknet - used a single coax cable and vampire taps for each computer
- Thinnet - also a single coax cable, but T-junctions are used for splitting
issues for both - power drain, no privacy (selective information sharing)
- token ring - no _single_ network resource used; computers are connected in series
only once computer could send data at a time (you "had the token")
